            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 text-center" id="text">

                <p id="paragraph1">
                    1. Meat products have bigger carbon footprints per calorie than grains or vegetables. That's
                    because
                    animals like cattle, sheep and goats produce a lot of methane gas. In 2016, they produced
                    170
                    million metric tons in CO2e of methane, according to a carbon footprint fact sheet compiled
                    by the
                    Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan. And yes, all that ends up in
                    the
                    atmosphere.</p>

                <p id="paragraph2">2. Meat isn't the only problem, the center says. Dairy products like cheese and yogurt
                    contribute almost
                    19% of greenhouse gases emitted -- even worse than poultry, seafood and eggs, which only
                    contribute
                    14% of greenhouse gases. Vegetables, meanwhile, contribute a mere 4.9%.</p>

                <p id="paragraph3">3. The center found that on average, one American household emits 8.1 metric tons of CO2e
                    each year
                    through food consumption alone. Yes, that's TONS. The production of food accounts for 83% of
                    emissions, and its transportation accounts for 11%.
                </p>
                <p id="paragraph4">4. And the fact sheet points out that if you follow the speed limit, not only will you not
                    get a ticket,
                    you'll also improve your fuel economy and, by extension, shrink your carbon footprint
                    through
                    greater fuel efficiency. You'll also be better off -- literally. The center found that when
                    driving
                    50 mph or more, every 5 mph increase is equivalent to paying between 20 and 40 cents more
                    per
                    gallon.</p>
                <p id="paragraph5">5. Speaking of your commute: Transportation is one of the biggest producers of CO2, only
                    behind
                    electricity generation, according to environmental advocacy group NuEnergy.</p>

                <p id="paragraph6">6. Reducing waste, surprise surprise, actually makes a difference. For every 10% of waste
                    reduction, you
                    can avoid 1,200 pounds of CO2e, according to the Center for Sustainable Systems. And that's
                    not just
                    recycling, that's also simply by buying products with less packaging and refusing plastic
                    bags at
                    the grocery store.</p>
                <p id="paragraph7">7. NuEnergy says that fossil fuels and coal are the source of 67% of generated electricity.
                    If you're
                    trying to reduce your carbon footprint, think about that next time you leave the lights on.
                </p>
                <p id="paragraph8">8. Corperations, unsurprisingly, have the biggest carbon footprints of all. Just 100
                    companies are
                    responsible for more than 70% of the world's emissions, according to a 2017 report from the
                    nonprofit CDP in collaboration with the Climate Accountability Institute.</p>
