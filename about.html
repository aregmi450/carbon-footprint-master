    <h1> WHAT IS CARBON FOOTPRINT ? </h1>
    <p>
        A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by
        our actions.
        
        The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world.
        Globally, the average is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2℃ rise in global temperatures, the
        average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop under 2 tons by 2050.
        
        Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons doesn’t happen overnight! By making small changes to our
        actions, like eating less meat, taking less connecting flights and line drying our clothes, we can start making a big
        difference.
